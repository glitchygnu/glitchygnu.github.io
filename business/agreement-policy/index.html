        <h1>Agreement for Purchase of Goods</h1>
        <p>This Agreement is entered into between the Seller and the Customer. By purchasing any product from us, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to all of the above terms and conditions. Your purchase constitutes acceptance of this Agreement and signifies your commitment to adhere to the regulations outlined herein.</p>

        <h2>1. Product Pricing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You acknowledge and agree that the prices for the products, including but not limited to Coca-Cola or any other items we sell, may be slightly higher than those typically found in retail outlets. The price difference reflects various factors, including but not limited to convenience and service provided by us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Recycling and Waste Disposal</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You agree to properly recycle all packaging and waste materials associated with the product(s) you purchase from us. This includes the return of bottles for “Pfand” (deposit) as applicable under the German recycling system.</li>
            <li>Customers who return eligible Pfand bottles may receive a discount of between €0.10 and €0.20 off their next purchase, depending on the specific product and its associated discount criteria. This offer is only applicable to products with a purchase price of €1.50 or more. For products priced below €1.50, this policy does not apply. The discount is non-transferable and may be subject to change at the discretion of the business. By participating in this offer, customers acknowledge and agree to the terms outlined.</li>
            <li>You commit to adhering to local recycling laws and disposing of packaging responsibly to minimize environmental impact.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Parental Consent for Purchase</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>By purchasing any goods sold by us, if you are under the age of 18, you confirm that you have received consent from your parent(s) or legal guardian(s) to purchase and consume such items.</li>
            <li>Our products may be purchased by individuals under the age of 18. As such, we do not require explicit authorization from a guardian or parent to complete a purchase. However, by making a purchase, the customer confirms that they have obtained the necessary approval from their guardian or parent. In the event that it is later determined that a guardian has not authorized such purchases, this will not affect the validity of the transaction or the terms of sale. Customers and their guardians assume full responsibility for ensuring that any purchases made comply with relevant rules and parental consent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Health and Liability Disclaimer</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>By purchasing any product from us, you acknowledge and agree that we, as a business, are not responsible for any medical issues or health-related concerns that may arise from the consumption of the goods sold, including but not limited to allergic reactions, sensitivities, or other health-related issues.</li>
            <li>When we sell products to customers under the age of 18, we are assuming that the parent(s) or guardian(s) have given their consent for the consumption of these products. It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure that they have received the appropriate consent from their parent(s) or guardian(s).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. No Refund or Return Policy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Due to the nature of the goods we sell, <span class="important">NO refunds or returns</span> are allowed except where required by law, such as in cases where a product is damaged or defective upon receipt.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Product Quality and Description</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We strive to ensure that all products are described accurately and are of the highest quality. However, we do not guarantee that the products will always meet specific expectations as these can vary from customer to customer. Should there be an issue with the quality of the product upon receipt, please inform us immediately to address the situation appropriately.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important">Limitation of Claims:</span> To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, our liability for any claim arising out of this Agreement or the sale of products is limited to the amount paid by you for the specific product(s) related to the claim.</li>
            <li>We are not responsible for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including but not limited to medical expenses or personal injury that may result from the use of any products purchased from us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. School Regulations and Liability</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>By purchasing any products from us, you acknowledge and agree that, to the best of your knowledge, the sale of such products is not prohibited by any specific rules or regulations set forth by the school.</li>
            <li>You confirm that you have reviewed the school rules and regulations, and to your understanding, there are no explicit restrictions on selling or distributing goods such as those offered by us (e.g., Coca-Cola or other similar items) to fellow students.</li>
            <li>In the event of any legal claims made by the school or school authorities regarding the sale of our products, we disclaim any responsibility or liability for disputes arising from the school’s internal regulations. We encourage parents and students to review the school’s policies to ensure compliance with any specific school rules or guidelines that may apply.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Important Notes for Legal Protection</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important">Governing Law and Jurisdiction:</span> This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Germany, and any disputes arising from this Agreement shall be resolved in the competent courts of Darmstadt, Landkreis Darmstadt-Dieburg, Hesse, Germany.</li>
            <li><span class="important">Force Majeure:</span> We are not liable for failure to fulfill any obligations under this Agreement due to events beyond our control, including but not limited to natural disasters, strikes, governmental actions, pandemics, or any other force majeure event as defined under German law. In such cases, the affected party shall notify the other party as soon as reasonably possible.</li>
